                <p>If it were located anywhere else in the world, Lombok would be on everyone’s bucket list. But because it’s just east of Bali, fewer people have heard of its secluded coves, endless string of cream-colored beaches, and waterfalls crashing through its impossibly lush foliage. Fine with us, because that means it’s also less crowded. You can spot wild macaques in the trees of Baun Pusak or float with the green and hawksbill turtles around Gili Meno without feeling like there’s a line behind you. This Indonesian island has a high point that Bali can’t match: Mount Rinjani, an active volcano with a massive lake inside its caldera. An early morning hike lets you watch the sun rise over the sea.</p>

                <p>The volcanic activity that formed Mount Rinjani is due to the subduction of the Indo-Australian oceanic crust beneath the Lesser Sunda Islands (an archipelago of which Lombok is part). In its current form, Mt Rinjani and its large crater lake are thought to have formed when Mt Samalas erupted in 1257. This eruption was colossal in scale, and is believed to have contributed to a period of global cooling and mini ice age. Mt Barujari (which sits in the crater lake, Segara Anak) is the active part of this historic volcanic system. It is believed by geologists that Mt Samalas stood next to Mt Rinjani. If you imagine the slopes that lead up to the caldera continuing to a summit, you can speculate as to where Samalas stood, and how high. </p>
